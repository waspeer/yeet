# HTTP API contract (phase 1)

This is the contract between the Worker (`packages/worker`), the CLI
(`packages/cli`) and the browser upload page. Changes to it are deliberate and
recorded here first. Behaviour not mentioned stays as in
`packages/worker/src/index.ts` at the start of phase 1.

## Hard constraints

- **CPU:** every request stays within **10 ms CPU** on Workers Free with
  `SENTRY_DSN` unset. This is measured on a real deploy, not with
  `wrangler dev`, which does not enforce limits.
- **Subrequests:** at most 50 per request, R2 calls included.
- **Request bodies:** at most 100 MB.
- **The `UPLOAD_TOKEN` never reaches the browser.** It must not appear in HTML,
  in JS, in browser storage, in cookies (only values derived from it via HMAC
  may), or in any request the page makes. The page authenticates with a
  session cookie.

## Keys derived from `UPLOAD_TOKEN`

All signing keys are HMAC-SHA256 keys derived from the token with a fixed label:
`key(label) = SHA-256("yeet-" + label + ":" + UPLOAD_TOKEN)`.

| Label      | Signs                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `download` | Signed `/_dl/:id` links (existing behaviour) |
| `session`  | Browser session cookies                      |
| `dlpass`   | Download-pass cookies (after a password)     |

Changing `UPLOAD_TOKEN` invalidates all sessions, download passes and open
download links at once.

## Token requirements

- `UPLOAD_TOKEN` must be **at least 16 characters**.
- If it is missing or shorter, every route needing it (`/api/*`, `/login`,
  `/upload`, password downloads) refuses with a clear message:
  - **API:** `500 {"error": "UPLOAD_TOKEN must be set and at least 16 characters long"}`.
  - **Pages:** an HTML error page with the same message.
- Public download pages for unprotected files keep working.

## Authentication

There are two ways in. `/api/*` accepts either:

1. **Bearer token (CLI):** `Authorization: Bearer <UPLOAD_TOKEN>`. It must match
   exactly, compared in constant time. No cookie or Origin checks apply.
2. **Session cookie (browser):** `yeet_session`.
   - **Unsafe methods** (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) also require an
     `Origin` header equal to the request's origin. Without one, or if it
     differs, the server answers `403 {"error": "Cross-origin request refused"}`.
   - **`Sec-Fetch-Site`:** if present, it must be `same-origin`, otherwise the
     same 403.

If neither is valid: `401 {"error": "Invalid upload token"}`. This message
stays the same as today; the CLI and the tests depend on it.

### Session cookie

- **Name:** `yeet_session`.
- **Value:** `v1.<expiresUnixSeconds>.<base64url(HMAC(key("session"), "session:v1:" + expires))>`.
- **Attributes:**
  - `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Path=/; Max-Age=7776000` (90 days).
  - Plus `Secure` when the request URL is `https:`. It is omitted on
    `http://localhost` so local development and tests work in WebKit.
- **Valid when:** the signature verifies (constant time) and the expiry is in
  the future.

### Routes

- `GET /upload`
  - **Without a valid session:** a login form.
  - **With a valid session:** the upload UI.
  - **Always:** `Cache-Control: no-store`.
- `POST /login` (form field `token`, from `/upload`). Same Origin rule as
  unsafe API calls.
  - **Correct token:** set the session cookie, then `303` to `/upload`.
  - **Wrong token:** `401` with the login form and the error "That token is not
    correct."
  - **Rate-limited:** `429` with a `Retry-After` header and the login form plus
    "Too many attempts. Try again in N seconds."
- `POST /logout`: clears the cookie (`Max-Age=0`), then `303` to `/upload`.
  Same Origin rule.

## Rate limiting

| What                                             | Limit                                                   | Key            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Failed `POST /login`                             | 5 per minute                                            | client IP      |
| Wrong download passwords on `POST /:id/download` | 5 per minute per upload                                 | client IP + id |
| Failed Bearer auth on `/api/*`                   | 20 per minute (protects the token from online guessing) | client IP      |

- **When exceeded:** `429` with `Retry-After`. Pages show a readable message;
  the API returns `{"error": "Too many attempts, retry in N s"}`.
- **What counts:** only failures. Successful requests never count.
- **Mechanism:** free-plan only. The implementer evaluates the Workers Rate
  Limiting binding, the Cache API and Durable Objects on the free plan, and
  records the choice and its trade-offs (per-colo vs global, accuracy, CPU
  and subrequest cost) in this file.

## Download passwords

- **Storage:** the stored hash format stays `pbkdf2-sha256$<iterations>$<salt>$<hash>`.
  The iteration count lives in the hash, so changing it never breaks
  existing links.
- **Download pass:** after a correct password, the response also sets
  `yeet_dl_<id>`:
  - **Value:** `<expires>.<base64url(HMAC(key("dlpass"), id + ":" + expires))>`.
  - **Attributes:** `HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax; Path=/<id>`, plus `Secure` on
    https. `Max-Age` is the shorter of 24 h and the time until the file
    expires.
  - **Effect:** while it is valid, `GET /:id/:filename` shows the Download
    button without a password field, and `POST /:id/download` skips the
    password check.
- **Iterations:** lowering them is a last resort. First measure CPU again with
  Sentry loading only when `SENTRY_DSN` is set, and with the download pass in
  place. If lowering is still needed, record the new count and the measured
  reason here, together with the rate limit.

## Upload API changes

- **`POST /api/uploads`** `{ filename, size?, expires_in, password? }` →
  `201 { id, part_size }`.
  - `size` is optional. If given, it must be a safe non-negative integer.
  - `part_size` stays 52,428,800 (50 MiB).
- **`PUT /api/uploads/:id/parts/:n`**
  - **Required:** a `Content-Length` header (`411` without it).
  - **Too large:** `Content-Length` above `part_size` gives
    `413 {"error": "Part larger than part_size"}`.
  - **Order:** R2 requires every part except the last to be exactly
    `part_size`. The server checks this as early as it can. A client that sends
    a short part and then a higher-numbered part gets a clear `400` at the
    latest at `complete`, never R2's opaque error.
- **`POST /api/uploads/:id/complete`** `{ parts, size? }`.
  - **Validated before completing:** the parts array (shape, numbers 1..n,
    no duplicates, etags are strings).
  - **Stored size:** `file_size` comes from R2's `object.size` after the
    upload completes.
  - **Mismatch:** if the client sent `size` (at create or at complete) and it
    differs from `object.size`, the upload is deleted and the server answers
    `422` with both numbers.
- **Pending uploads:** they are never listed, and their pages return 404. This
  is unchanged.

## Sentry

Sentry is only initialised, and its wrapper only used, when `SENTRY_DSN` is
set. Without it, requests do not pay any Sentry CPU cost.

## Unchanged

Download links (`/_dl/:id`, Range support), the bucket layout and the
custom-metadata summary, cleanup, and `GET /api/uploads` and
`DELETE /api/uploads/:id` (beyond the auth changes above).
